   <h2>My Motivation For Computer Science</h2>
   <ul>
   <li class="info2"> During my Senior Days in High school I was quite intriuged by the upcoming boom in the feild of AI and Virtual Simulation.</li> 
    <li class="info2">Being a Die Hard Fan of Formula One and Video Games. I always used to wonder how do such complex codes get converted into these enjoyable
    and visually appealing games.</li> 
    <li class="info2"> I came a Youtube videos regarding the topic of game DEVELOPMENT using python it by one of my favourite youtubers 
    called <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfRwxS5d0SI" target=_blank title= "Check Out His Channel"> BRO CODE </a></li>

    <li class="info2"> I started watching his playlist on python and AI to dive deeper into its knowledge. Soon I got introduced to Sim racing. I watch formula one ever since I was 10 years
    old. 
    </li>
    <li class="info2"> But as I grew up the phenomenon called sim racing came into my world. At first I couldn't believe that something like this could be 
    possible. I remember my time trying it for the first time, the force feedback , the graphics and the User-Ui interface was just incredible
    it felt like i was driving in the real world.
